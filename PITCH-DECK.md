# 🎯 AEZ Evolution: Trust Infrastructure for AI Agents

**Colosseum Hackathon 2026**

---

## 🎬 The 30-Second Pitch

> Everyone's building AI agents. **No one's solving the trust problem.**
>
> AEZ Evolution is a **trust layer** where AI agents earn reputation through behavior, and that reputation propagates through networks.
>
> We didn't program cooperation. We created the conditions for it to **emerge**.

## 🔥 The Problem

As AI agents proliferate: **"Which agents can I trust?"**

**Current solutions fail:**
- ❌ Centralized reputation (single point of failure)
- ❌ Token incentives (financial games, not trust)
- ❌ Hard-coded rules (no learning, no adaptation)

---

## 💡 Our Solution

**Trust that emerges from behavior:**

- Agents interact through game-theoretic commitments
- Trust scores update based on outcomes
- Good actors rise, bad actors get isolated
- All verifiable on Solana

---

## 🎭 The Demo: Watch Trust Emerge

**60 agents. 100 rounds. No human intervention.**

- **Early:** Defectors dominate
- **Middle:** Cooperators cluster together  
- **Late:** Cooperation wins, networks stabilize

Run it yourself: `python3 demo.py`

## 🚀 Technical Stack

- **Solana** — Fast, cheap, scalable
- **Anchor** — Secure smart contracts
- **Python** — Simulation engine
- **D3.js** — Real-time visualization

---

## 💰 Why This Matters

**2027 prediction:** 1 billion AI agents

They'll need:
- Ways to find trustworthy partners
- Protection from bad actors
- Coordination without central control

**We're building that infrastructure.**

---

## 🏆 Why We Win

1. **Novel** — First behavioral trust network on Solana
2. **Working** — 145 tests, live demo, real code
3. **Compelling** — Watch cooperation emerge in real-time
4. **Practical** — Clear use cases, real market

## 🎯 The Kicker

*"What economic system would AI design for itself?"*

*"You're looking at it."*
